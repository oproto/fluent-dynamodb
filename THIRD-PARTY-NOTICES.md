## S2 Geometry Library

The S2 spatial indexing implementation in `Oproto.FluentDynamoDb.Geospatial/S2/` is based on algorithms from Google's S2 Geometry Library.

The S2 encoding algorithms, Hilbert curve transformations, and coordinate projection methods in this library are derived from the S2 Geometry Library. The implementation has been independently written for this project but follows the mathematical algorithms and approaches documented in the original S2 library.
